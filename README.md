# Custom Render Function for React-Like Elements

This repository contains a simple implementation of a custom rendering function inspired by React's rendering process. The function `customRender` takes a virtual element representation and renders it as a DOM element within a specified container.

## Introduction

React is a popular JavaScript library that revolutionized front-end web development with its component-based architecture and virtual DOM. One of the core features of React is its ability to create and render virtual elements that map to actual DOM elements. This repository provides a basic version of that concept by demonstrating how a custom `customRender` function can be used to create and render elements in a simplified manner.

## Usage

To use the `customRender` function, follow these steps:

1. Include the `customRender` function from the `index.js` file in your project.

2. Define a virtual element using an object structure with the following properties:
   - `type`: The HTML tag name (e.g., `"a"` for an anchor element).
   - `props`: An object containing the element's attributes (e.g., `{ href: "https://example.com", target: "_blank" }`).
   - `children`: The content inside the element.

3. Select a DOM container element where the rendered element will be appended.

4. Call the `customRender` function with the virtual element and container as arguments:
   ```javascript
   const reactElement = {
     type: "a",
     props: {
       href: "https://example.com",
       target: "_blank",
     },
     children: "Visit Example",
   };

   const mainContainer = document.querySelector("#root");

   customRender(reactElement, mainContainer);
   ```

## Example

An example is provided in the `index.js` file, showcasing how the `customRender` function can be used to render a simple anchor element. This demonstrates the process of converting a virtual element into a DOM element and appending it to a container.

## How It Works

The `customRender` function simulates React's rendering process by dynamically creating a DOM element based on the provided virtual element (`reactElement`). It uses the `type` property to determine the HTML tag, applies attributes from the `props` property, and sets the content from the `children` property. The element is then appended to the specified container.

The implementation showcases a simplified version of React's core concept, demonstrating how a custom rendering function can replicate the behavior of React's `createElement` and JSX features.
